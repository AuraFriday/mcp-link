# Aura Friday Royalty Policy

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-25

This policy outlines the compensation terms for all content licensed to Aura Friday for distribution on the mcp-link Store, as per our Exclusive Content License Agreement. Our model is designed to be a transparent partnership.

### 1. Royalty Calculation

Your royalty is calculated based on the **Net Revenue** received by Aura Friday from the sale of your Content. Here is the formula:

1.  **Start with the List Price:** The advertised pre-tax price of your Content.
2.  **Subtract Aura Friday's Platform Fee:** We retain a **35% Platform Fee** calculated from the List Price. This fee covers our platform's development, security auditing, and marketing.
3.  **Subtract Direct Costs:** We then subtract all direct, third-party costs associated with the transaction. These costs include, but are not limited to:
    *   Payment processing fees (e.g., from PayPal, Stripe).
    *   Currency conversion fees.
    *   Applicable refunds and chargebacks.
4.  **The Result is Your Royalty:** The remaining amount is the royalty payable to you.

**Example Calculation:**
*   List Price of your recipe: **$1.00**
*   Aura Friday Platform Fee (35% of $1.00): **-$0.35**
*   Payment Processor Fees (e.g., PayPal Micropayments at ~4.99% + $0.09): **-$0.14**
*   **Your Payable Royalty: $1.00 - $0.35 - $0.14 = $0.51**

*(Note: This is an example. Actual payment processor fees may vary.)*

### 2. Payout Schedule & Hold Period
To protect our platform and users from fraud and transaction reversals, all earned royalties are subject to a **99-day holding period** from the date of the successful sale. After the holding period, cleared royalties become available for payout.

### 3. Payout Requirements
In order to receive any royalty payments, you **must**:
a. Have a minimum cleared royalty balance of $50 USD or equivalent.
b. Successfully complete our mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification process via our designated payout platform. This is a one-time requirement.

### 4. Forfeiture of Royalties
You are required to successfully complete the KYC process within **180 days** of your first royalty being earned. If you fail to complete this process within the specified time, you will forfeit all accrued and future royalties, and your account may be suspended.
