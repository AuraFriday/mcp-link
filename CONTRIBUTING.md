# How to Contribute to mcp-link

We deeply appreciate community interest in improving mcp-link. To protect our users and maintain the project's stringent security, quality, and a unified codebase, we follow a centralized contribution model:

**This project does not use GitHub Forks or Pull Requests.** All contributions are submitted as patch files directly to an issue ticket after discussion with the maintainer. Please follow the process below carefully.

### Our Contribution Process

1.  **Propose Your Change in an Issue:** Before writing any code, please **[open a new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/AuraFriday/mcp-link/issues/new/choose)**. This initial discussion ensures your proposed work aligns with the project's direction.

2.  **Agree to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA):** We cannot review or accept any code until you have publicly agreed to our [CLA](CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). Once your proposal in the Issue has been acknowledged, please paste the following exact statement as a new comment in your Issue thread:
    > `I have read and agree to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) located in this repository's CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md file. I understand that this assignment of rights is a precondition to my contribution being considered for acceptance.`

3.  **Submit Your Code as a Patch File:** Once approved, prepare and attach your patch file(s) to the GitHub Issue as instructed in the guide below. **Do NOT submit a Pull Request.**

### How to Prepare and Submit Your Code Contribution

This guide will walk you through the entire process, from getting the code to generating the final patch file.

**Step 0: Get the Code (The Right Way)**

First, you need a local copy of our official repository.

```bash
# Clone the repository from the official AuraFriday source.
# Do NOT work from an unauthorized fork.
git clone https://github.com/AuraFriday/mcp-link.git

# Navigate into the newly created directory
cd mcp-link
```

**Step 1: Ensure Your Local Branch is Up-to-Date**

Before starting any work, make sure your local `master` branch has the very latest changes from our repository.

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

**Step 2: Create a Dedicated Branch for Your Work**

Never work directly on your `master` branch. Creating a feature branch isolates your changes and simplifies patch creation.

```bash
# Name the branch something descriptive
git checkout -b feature/my-new-tool
```

**Step 3: Write Your Code and Make Atomic Commits**

This is the most important step for a clean patch.
*   Make small, logical changes.
*   Create a new commit for each logical change.
*   Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the *what* and *why* of your change.

```bash
# Example of a good commit workflow
# (edit file1.js, file2.js)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add geolocation tool foundation"

# (edit file3.js)
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Correct error handling in geolocation response"
```
**Pro Tip:** One feature might be several commits. This is good! It makes your changes easier to review.

**Step 4: Generate the `.patch` File(s)**

Once your feature is complete, use the `git format-patch` command. This will create one `.patch` file for each commit you made on your feature branch.

```bash
# This compares your current branch to our primary branch ('master') and creates the patches.
git format-patch master
```
This command will create numbered files in your directory, like `0001-feat-Add-geolocation-tool-foundation.patch`, `0002-fix-Correct-error-handling-in-geolocation-response.patch`, etc.

**Step 5: Attach the Patch(es) to Your GitHub Issue**

*   If you have only one `.patch` file, attach it directly to your comment in the GitHub Issue.
*   If you have multiple `.patch` files, please compress them into a single `.zip` archive and attach that zip file to the issue.
