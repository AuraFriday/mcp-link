# 🎉 Welcome to MCP-Link!

Thanks for installing **MCP-Link** — the powerful bridge that lets AI agents control tools, automate tasks, and work directly inside your browser!

Whether you're using ChatGPT, Claude, or another AI model, **MCP-Link** makes your browser come alive with real-world action and intelligent automation.

## 🚀 What is MCP-Link?

MCP-Link connects your browser to powerful **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**. This allows AI agents to:

* 🧠 Call tools like file access, weather, semantic database, geolocation, github, and more
* 🔍 Interact with web pages in helpful, user-visible ways
* 🔄 Chain tool outputs across services for complex automation
* 🔒 Keep you in full control with per-tool permissions and confirmations

This gives AIs real power — safely — using *your* rules, *your* tools, and *your* browser.

## ♿ Empowering Accessibility and Inclusion

**MCP-Link** was built with accessibility in mind from the very beginning. For users with visual impairments, mobility challenges, or cognitive limitations, navigating the web can be frustrating or even impossible.

With MCP-Link, those barriers start to fade.

By connecting your browser to trusted AI models, MCP-Link enables smart assistants that can **read, understand, and help operate your computer, phone, and websites — on your terms**.

Whether it’s summarizing complex layouts, clicking through menus, or assisting with routine tasks, **MCP-Link gives users a powerful voice and control mechanism, even when traditional input methods fall short.**

This is more than convenience — it’s **digital equity** in action.

## ✅ Getting Started

Please take a moment to finish setup:

### 📌 1. **Pin MCP-Link to your toolbar**

So you can easily open it any time:

* Click the <img src="assets/puzzle.png" width="31" height="31" alt="puzzle-piece icon"> Extensions icon (top right of Chrome)
* Find **MCP-Link**, then click the 📌 pin icon

### ⚙️ 2. **Configure your MCP Server**

If you haven't installed a local MCP SSE server yet, you can:

* Run your own (recommended for power users)
* Or use a remote/shared server via a URL

Open the MCP-Link popup → **Settings**, then enter the URL of your MCP server.

> For local setups, this is usually:
> `https://127-0-0-1.local.aurafriday.com:31173/sse`
> or your local LAN IP.

## 💬 3. Start using it!

Visit an AI model that supports tool access (like [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) or [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)).

Your MCP server will show up as a tool, ready to help the AI:

* Solve problems
* Trigger actions
* Automate your workflows

MCP-Link will ask for confirmation before any tools are used — you remain in control at all times.
