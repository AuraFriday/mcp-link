# Privacy Policy for mcp-link

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-25

Welcome to mcp-link. Your privacy is not an afterthought; it is a core principle of our architecture. This policy explains what data we process and, more importantly, what we **do not**.

Our guiding principle is simple: **we collect the absolute minimum data necessary to provide our service, and in most cases, that means we collect nothing at all.**

### 1. The "Zero-Collection" Principle

For the core functionality of the mcp-link Software (the browser extension, server, and apps):

*   **We DO NOT collect or store any personal data.**
*   **We DO NOT use any third-party analytics, metrics, or telemetry services.**
*   **We DO NOT track your browsing history or your interactions with AI agents.**

The Software is designed to operate on your devices, under your control. Any data processed by a tool or recipe remains on your local machine or is sent directly to an endpoint you have configured. This data is never sent to, seen by, or stored by Aura Friday.

Software updates are managed by the official marketplaces (like the Chrome Web Store), which have their own privacy policies.

### 2. Data Processing You Control

The mcp-link Software, by its nature, interacts with data to function. This processing happens under your explicit control:
*   **Browser Extension:** The extension reads page content to enable AI interactions but does not transmit this data to us.
*   **MCP Server:** When you run the local server, it may access local files or services as configured by you. This is entirely local to your machine or network.

### 3. The mcp-link Store & Creator Accounts

The mcp-link Store, when enabled, is where users can buy and sell recipes.  The store operator (us at present, but subject to change) will need to collect certain information **only from users who choose to create a creator or customer account.** If you do not create a Store account, this section does not apply to you.

For Store account holders, we will need to collect:
*   **Account Information:** Your name, email address, and chosen username.
*   **Transaction Information:** A history of recipes you have licensed or sold. All payment processing is handled by secure, third-party payment providers. We do not see or store your full credit card information.

### 4. Identity Verification (KYC) for Recipe Creators

To comply with global financial regulations and prevent fraud, creators who wish to receive royalty payments from the Store must complete a mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification process.

This process will be handled by a specialized, secure third-party provider. The data collected for this purpose (e.g., government-issued ID, proof of address) is used solely for identity verification and is governed by the privacy policy of the verification provider. Aura Friday does not store these sensitive documents on its own servers.

### 5. Your Rights (GDPR & Global Privacy Standards)

We respect your rights over your data. You have the right to:
*   **Access:** Request a copy of the data we hold about you (if any).
*   **Rectification:** Correct any inaccurate data we hold about you.
*   **Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** Request that we delete your account and associated data.
*   **Object:** Object to the processing of your data.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email address below.

### 6. Data Security
We are committed to protecting your data. We implement industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 7. Children's Privacy
Our services are not directed to individuals classified as children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.

### 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on our website or through other communication channels.

### 9. Contact Us
