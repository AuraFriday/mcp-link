# 🔗 MCP Link — Let AI Agents Use Your Tools

**MCP Link** is a complete framework that enables AI agents to **interact with the real world** through a controlled, curated, safe and verified browser- and server-based toolchain.

This project enables:

* 🧠 **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Gemini**, **Perplexity**, **Grok**, and others to **discover and use tools** via an extension in your browser
* 🔧 A flexible **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that safely executes local or remote tools
* 🧩 A fully modular recipe + plugin system that supports AI integration, monetization, and control

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install the MCP Link browser extension**
   *(Chrome Web Store link coming soon)*

2. **Visit a supported AI site** like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity

3. **Let the AI suggest tools** — the extension handles the rest
   (no configuration required unless you want local tools)

> 🛠️ Want more power? After install, the extension will help you set up the optional MCP server for advanced local tool use.

---

## 🧠 What Is MCP?

**MCP** stands for **Model Context Protocol** — a simple runtime system that allows AI agents to:

* Discover user-allowed tools provided to the AI by the extension based on browser site recipes
* Call tools using structured markup; e.g. (`<antml:function_calls>`)
* Route tool execution to a local or remote server
* Receive formatted responses back into their current conversation

This gives AI models plugin-like powers **without cloud dependencies**, **without vendor lock-in**, and with **user-side control**.

---

## 🔐 Designed for Enterprise-Grade Trust

MCP Link is built for safe, auditable real-world AI action.

* 🧠 **Agents can only see tools you’ve approved**
* 🛑 **AIs cannot call any tool unless you’ve explicitly enabled it**
* 🧮 **Every call can prompt for user approval, unless you override it**
* 🧱 **Supports sandboxing via Docker for isolated tool environments**
* 📜 **Logs every tool request, tool response, and agent call**

Whether you’re letting ChatGPT rename a folder, wanting Gemini to book you a hotel, or asking Claude to run semantic SQL queries, MCP Link ensures you stay in control — every step of the way.

## 🧰 What This Repo Contains

This repo isn't just an extension — it's an entire AI-tool ecosystem:

| Folder            | Purpose                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `extension/`      | Lightweight browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.  |
| `remote/recipes/` | Enhancement recipes for popular AI sites (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) |
| `server/`         | MCP SSE backend server (Python 3.9+) for tool execution          |
| `store/`          | Licensing, gating, and optional payment/subscription logic       |
| `toolspecs/`      | Shared schemas and validation logic for tools + manifests        |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

MCP Link activates enhancement recipes in popular AI websites like:

* [ChatGPT.com](https://chatgpt.com)
* [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
* [gemini.google.com/app](https://gemini.google.com/app)
* [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)
* [x.com/i/grok](https://x.com/i/grok)

These recipes tell the AI how to discover and use the tools you approve it to use via your browser.

---

## 🧩 What Tools Can Be Called?

MCP Link enables AI agents to call both **remote tools** (hosted online) and **local tools** (run securely on your own machine or LAN).

Tools are activated using structured markup emitted by supported AI models and interpreted by the extension — but **only for tools the user has explicitly enabled**.

---

### 🧍‍♂️ User-Controlled Tool Access & Security

MCP Link gives **complete tool-level control to the user**.

Every tool goes through a two-step permissions process:

| Control Layer             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 **Tool Visibility**    | Users can enable or disable each tool via checkboxes in the extension UI. Only enabled tools are advertised to AI agents. Disabled tools are entirely invisible.                                                                                                                                                        |
| ✅ **Tool Usage Approval** | For enabled tools, the user can choose one of three runtime access policies:<br> - **Ask every time** — show a popup before the tool is used<br> - **Allow automatically** — skip popup for trusted tools<br> - **Always allow** ("YOLO Mode") — useful for sandboxed tools running in Docker or read-only environments |

These settings are stored **per tool** and **per user**, and can be changed at any time from the MCP Link extension popup.

---

🔄 Tool definitions, icons, security settings, and descriptions are dynamically fetched from:

[https://cdn.aurafriday.com/config.json](https://cdn.aurafriday.com/config.json)

This remote manifest allows new tools to be offered without requiring an extension update. The extension only shows tools the user has opted into and can **never activate tools without user permission.**

---

🔐 This permission architecture ensures:

* The AI can **never use tools you didn’t approve**
* Even for approved tools, you can choose to **review each use**
* If you trust a tool (e.g. running inside Docker), you can allow **hands-free execution**

---

> ✅ This browser extension **works immediately** with remote tools — no setup required.
> 🛠️ Users can later install local tools for richer offline or private workflows.

---

### 🌐 Remote Tools (Work Immediately, No Setup Required)

These tools are served from secure cloud providers and work out-of-the-box — no local server required. You can use any providers you like. All remote tools use HTTPS, CORS-safe, and privacy-compliant endpoints. The following from provider [https://mcp.aurafriday.com/sse](https://mcp.aurafriday.com/sse) are available from first install:

| 🌐 Tool ID          | ⚡ Description                                  | 🔓 Access |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `geolocation`       | Reveals your location using browser GPS or IP  | ✅ Free    |
| `weather`           | Fetches local weather info using your location | ✅ Free    |
| `adaptive_thinking` | Helps agents reflect, revise, and plan actions | ✅ Free    |

> *"Calling `geolocation` tool now using MCP Link... (you can inspect the request and response below)"*
> *▶ Show tool input/output*

---

### 🖥️ Local Tools (Optional, Powerful, Run on Your Machine or Local Network)

If the user installs any local **MCP Server**, like the optional one included in this repo, additional tools become available for deeper integration:

| 🛠️ Tool ID  | ⚡ Description                                                | 🔓 Access    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `cards`      | Draws random cards for agent decision-making                 | ✅ Free       |
| `sqlite`     | Runs semantic and raw SQL queries on your data               | ✅ Free       |
| `tts`        | Speaks text using your system's speakers                     | ✅ Free       |
| `stt`        | Transcribes audio from your microphone                       | ✅ Free       |
| `whatsapp`   | Sends messages via your personal WhatsApp                    | 🔐 Licensed  |
| `openrouter` | Proxies multiple AI models via user API keys                 | ✅ Configured |
| `ai_chat`    | Enables agent-to-agent chat coordination                     | 🔐 Licensed  |
| `docker`     | **Isolates tools and actions in a secure container sandbox** | ✅ Critical   |

> 🔐 **Docker integration** is a key differentiator. MCP Link can route tool calls into a **containerized environment**, reducing risk of file access, escalation, or unintended actions by AIs. This enables safe, real-world agentic control — even over powerful tools.

More tools added weekly. Some are free. Some may contain payment or subscription flows.

---

### 🔎 Transparent Tool Call Output

Whenever a tool is used, MCP Link displays a **dropdown summary** in your browser showing:

* ✅ The tool name
* 📤 The exact request sent
* 📥 The raw response returned
* 🕒 A timestamp for audit/logging

This ensures users stay fully informed — and AIs can explain their actions clearly.

> *"Here’s what I sent and received:"*
